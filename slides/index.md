## The First Way
<br />
#### Systems Thinking

---

## Value Streams
#### From Requirements to shipped software to customers!

' ADD PICTURE!

' It’s all about having a holistic view of the value stream, from requirements to shipped software to customers, or ' as they call, “it’s all about left to right“

---

### Assessment on the Performance of the entire system
##### How much time it takes do deploy a new line of code?
<br />
<br />

- It allows to apply Lean principles
    - Monitor WIP
    - Cycle Time
    - Lead Time
- Mean-Time-To-Repair (MTTR): elapsed time to repair a configuration item or IT service.
- Mean-Time-Between-Failure (MTBF): elapsed time between a service gets up and down.
- Mean-Time-To-Restore-Service (MTRS): elapsed time from the detection of an incident until it gets up.

---

### Focus is on all business value streams enabled by IT
<br />
#### Speed is THE Business Competitive Advantage!
<br />
#### Minimize WIP to reduce company's investment before ROI!
<br />
' This enables assessment on the performance of the entire system – fast flow of work and it allows to apply known ' Lean principles, like monitor WIP
' Focus is on all business value streams enabled by IT

---

### The outcomes of putting the First Way into practice include:
<br />

- never passing a known defect to downstream work centers
- never allowing local optimization to create global degradation
- always seeking to increase flow
- always seeking to achieve profound understanding of the system
